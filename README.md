The goal of Project Zeta is to develop the world's first General Intelligence. Yes, a robot uprising is coming. We, at Project Zeta, are determined to develop a reliable platform to collect, process, and train data to develop a human-like intelligence. This is possible by using a custom-built, biomimetic, robot dog, with tons of sensors for environmental perception. To learn more about the AI itself, look at this repo:

## The Idea
We are making a versatile and cost-effective development platform to collect data. This will allow us to not only collect data but also implement the general intelligence into the robot. In fact, our project MAGIST has achieved General Intelligence!

## Setup and Assembly
All assembly instructions will be provided on the Wiki page. The ROS Stack currently requires the "ros-noetic-desktop-full" which has dependencies for around 200 packages. This will only currently work on multi-core PCs and not on Raspberry Pi. This will eventually be optimized to compile on ARM CPUs. More information will be provided on compilation and setup when the code is functional.

## Open Source
The overall point of this project is to make it as open-source as possible. My code is open source, the motors I used also provide their code and all the information to recreate them, and my 3D model of the dog will be on Thingiverse soon.
