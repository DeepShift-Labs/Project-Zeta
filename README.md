# Project-Zeta
***This repository is incomplete and under development. There may be mistakes or missing information. Please bear with it. ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE CAN BE ASKED IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND ISSUES. Thank you for cooporating.***

The goal of Project Zeta is to develop the world's first General Intelligence. Yes, a robot uprising is coming. We, at Project Zeta, are determined to develop a reliable platform to collect, process, and train data to develop a human-like intelligence. This is possible by using a custom built, biomimetic, robot dog, with tons of sensors for environmental perception. This will be used to train a custom-built multi-agent Z-Algorithm to develop the intelligence.

## The Idea
The plan is to do what I call a "data dump reward strategy". The robot will collect LiDAR, RGBD, audio, tactile, and other sensory data. That data will be fed into 3 unique algorithms. 

Essentially, these algorithms combine to analyze the data and then create predictors to predict a new state of the robot. It will use several weighted data matrices and
action priority matricies that can give the predictors a better context. If you want to brainstorm ideas and get the latest updates, make a contribution to our OpenCollective! Check the Links section for the link!

***Please note, these are simply ideas and are due to change.***

## Setup and Assembly
All assembly instructions will be provided on the Wiki page. The ROS Stack currently requires the "ros-noetic-desktop-full" which has dependencies for around 200 packages. This will only currently work on multi-core PCs and not on Raspberry Pi. This will eventually be optimized to compile on ARM CPUs. More information will be provided on compilation and setup when the code is functional.

## Open Source
The overall point of this project is to make it as open source as possible. My code is open source, the motors I used also provide their code and all the information to recreate them, and my 3D model of the dog will be on Thingiverse soon.
