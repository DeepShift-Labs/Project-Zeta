# Project-Zeta
The ultimate robotics dog development framework. 


## Open Source
The whole point of this is to make it as open source as possible. Obviously, all of my code is open source, the motors I used also provide their code and all the information to recreate them, and the 3D model of the dog is on Thingiverse, hence open source.
